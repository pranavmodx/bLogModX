- covid life
- miss playing over the board chess
- a looot of online chess
- friends
- blindfold chess
- through whatsapp chat
- sparked an idea
- webapp
- none existed, or did but didn't allow so much custom settings
- didn't have to look around a lot to see if there was some way to communicate via browser
- had come across an amazing library by Subin earlier which required no servers ,nothing. check out his cool stuff here
- alternate, socketio, requires server
- expand technical stuff 
- drawbacks 
- building it
- troubles, problems
- mistakes - unecessary/too much refactoring hindering progress, not taking to effort to unlearn and relearn html css and basics, too afraid to ask for feedback from peers fearing criticism and demotivation, self-demotivating and self-doubting thoughts like is it really worth doing or is it good enough to release it to public. not polished. has lot of bugs. pile of unfinished projects. 
- learnings - takes time and effort, sincerity, dedication, consistency
what next ? - product hunt
