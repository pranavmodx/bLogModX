Wrote this poem in just an hour as part of the screening round (Theme - 'Dreams') for English Poetry event of the College Arts. Couldn't make it past the round but had fun writing it nonetheless.  
Here goes :


Often he lived in the vivid dream  
Where he envisioned his overnight success.  
He desired of establishing and leading a team  
But neglected the responsibilities and tasks in progress.  

Frenemies gathered in appreciation and praise  
And he brimmed with confidence and pride.  
For once worry and anxiety faded out of his ways  
As he entered the limelight and made his stride.  

He couldn’t wish for anything more  
For he had achieved what he set his heart on.  
No longer he saw his life as a chore  
As it felt like he had a respawn.  

It wasn’t long before he was perturbed  
By a strong wind gushing through his hair.  
Hours had passed by as he looked at the wall and stared.  
Soon he realized he spent another day on the armchair.
