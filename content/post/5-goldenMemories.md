I wonder how my childhood's been,
As one forgets when he begins to thrive.
My memory’s now full wiped and clean
Like a fully formatted computer hard drive.

I wish I could dig into the past,
Retrospect those golden memories,
And keep it until the last,
In the treasuries for centuries.

Perhaps a day would come
When all this becomes possible
As no one’s ever hindered from
Tracking down the impossible.

But till then I’ll have to wait
And keep my mind up to date.
