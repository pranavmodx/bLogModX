I used to draw a lot back when I was small. I mostly drew my favourite characters in cartoon shows like Tom and Jerry, Ben10 and others. I was very casual back then when it came to keeping the drawings safely, which is why I can't find any of them now.

For some reason I always feared drawing in a large sheet of paper. I think it must be because it looked like too much effort and so I hesitated. I sticked to as small a paper as I could find, only that there was never enough space to draw the head or the limbs of the character.

I remember drawing dinasaurs with my brother. He drew amazingly well! That T-Rex looked so real and intimidating. Meanwhile, mine was so thin and pale.
I think he only drew dinasaurs or something. Velociraptor, Triceratops, you name it.
I hardly have memories of him drawing something other than a dinosaur.

There's barely any time to 'waste' in drawing now or so I say to myself and what I feel others would say too.

But quite recently, I thought of reviving the artist in me (*ahem*) and start drawing again. Maybe at times when I didn't feel like doing anything else.
But honestly, drawing with a regular pencil didn't feel so good now as back then. Maybe it is to do with how less often we even use a pencil for our daily work, unless you're an artist or a architect or anything.
I wished there was something else and at once I saw my brother's Pen Tablet lying around covered in dust. I hadn't really tried or tested it well and I never thought it could be as effective as it is proving to be each day!

It is great for making notes, scribbling down any important stuff quickly, and mainly digital art among other things! It took a little time getting used to it but now it feels like any other pen and it's smooth as butter. The best part is : no trouble of rubbing the paper (and tearing it eventually) when you make a mistake or finding that perfect drawing pencil, brush or any related tool. Everything is digital.

I tried watching somes videos on digital art and installed a couple of fancy related softwares around it. Pretty soon I got hooked.

For a start, I drew Bugs Bunny from Looney Tunes in [AutoDesk SketchBook](https://www.autodesk.com/products/sketchbook/overview) (completely free software) from an old website called [Drago Art](https://dragoart.com/) from where I used to draw when I was small. It gives step by step sketches and figures leading to the final drawing.

It's not the perfect piece ever but I had a lot of fun nonetheless. It brought back a lot of good memories.

I highly recommend buying a pen tablet if you're into drawing or animation or just digital note making and journaling. You'll simply love it.
