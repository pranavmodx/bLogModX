A poem dedicated to people who value good friendships.
  
Life is bright and beautiful,  
For when he has that special friend  
His brimming emotions never end.  
But when she is rash and undutiful  
It chokes him with pain and sorrow,  
And he can but only hope it will be better tomorrow.  

He thinks it over and over,  
For he cannot fathom her changeover.  
Time and again he reminisces the good times spent,  
And wishes to undo the wrongs and prevent.  

He starts questioning himself -   
Is it because she is annoyed and upset  
That he took her precious time and hence beset?  

Often times he lowers himself  
Trying to fix the broken friendship,  
For who else is there at times of his hardship?  

But again, as the saying goes, "If thou art not for thyself,  
Who will be for thee?"  
Sometimes it is best to be alone and free.  

They might not be close anymore,   
But he would be there when she looks for.
